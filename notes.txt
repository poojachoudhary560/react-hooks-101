why Hooks?
- Understand how this works in JS
- Remember to bind event handlers in class components
- Classes dont minify very well and makes hot reloading very unreliable
Set 2
- There is no particular way to reuse stateful component logic
- HOC and render props do address this problem
- Makes code harder to follow
- There is a need to share stateful logic in a better way
Set 3
- Instead of forcing a stateful code split on based on lifecycle methods, it allows
you to split on based on related code
Hooks help us organise our code into reusable logic
